# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - James Hegedus

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, round 01. Started on [Jan 1, Monday, 2018].

## Goals

Write code daily. Although I've been programming for years I find it difficult to sit, focus and code consistently. I often find I will begin something and then proceed to read everything about the topic for days before writing any code to solve the problem. I want to solve problems sooner by changing this behaviour.

> To be knowledgeable does not imply proficiency.

## Projects

* Learn [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) and [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/) by writing an [exercism.io](https://v2.exercism.io/my/tracks/ocaml) track - This will teach language features similar to the OCaml track but with additional focus on creating JS libs, BS bindings and some React web development.
* Write a Wildlife Hotline app allowing users to report injured wildlife to the correct authorities.
* Write my serverless-graphql lib with ReasonML.

## Log

### R1D1: Jan 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

* Started development on a PWA template repo with Firebase integration.
* Setup some of the config and boilerplate for ReasonML exercism track (based off of the OCaml and JavaScript tracks).

**Thoughts:**

* I plan to build many PWAs and so wish to reduce startup time of my projects with a template. Many templates exist, but I wish to have a standard that is opinionated in ways existing projects are not.
* I want to be proficient with ReasonML. I like the structured learning offered by exercism.io but there is no track for ReasonML. There is also little to no resources on the process of creating a BuckleScript binding for a project so I wish to cover Reason's integration with the JS ecosystem within the learning materials. I see the structure as something like: learn ReasonML language features, learn how to use JS in Reason with BuckleScript, build a bs-binding for a couple of JS packages, cover Reason-React web dev.
