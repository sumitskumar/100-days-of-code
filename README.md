# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - James Hegedus

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, round 01. Started on [Dec 30, Saturday, 2017].

## Goals

Write code daily. Although I've been programming for years I find it difficult to sit, focus and code consistently. I often find I will begin something and then proceed to read everything about the topic for days before writing any code to solve the problem. I want to change this.

> To be knowledgeable does not imply proficiency.

## Projects

* Learn [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) and [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/) by writing an [exercism.io](https://v2.exercism.io/my/tracks/ocaml) track - This will teach language features similar to the OCaml track but with additional focus on creating JS libs, BS bindings and some React web development.
* Write a Wildlife Hotline app allowing users to report injured wildlife to the correct authorities.
* Write my serverless-graphql lib with ReasonML.
